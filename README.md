# Image Generation with DCGAN: Pokemon Dataset
 In this project we will be exploring how we can use a DCGAN to generate new images

## Overview

This project focuses on generating images of Pokemon using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. Building upon a Kaggle source code, I experimented with different neural network architectures to improve the quality of generated images. Additionally, I made the source code object-oriented and fixed a random seed for reproducibility.

## Dependencies

- **PyTorch**: Utilized for the conception and implementation of various neural network architectures for image generation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pokemon dataset sourced from Kaggle. It contains images of various Pokemon species, which serve as the basis for generating new images.

## Future Projects

In the future, I plan to continue building upon this project to further improve the quality of the generated images. This may involve exploring advanced techniques and architectures proposed in research papers for image generation using neural networks.
